# Define your goal

## The WHY of goal setting

The Entity Portrait gave a deep understanding of who the design is for. With this understanding it is possible to define what success should look like, using goals and objectives.Not only for a platform owner but also for the different entities within the ecosystem. Aim for a combination of both!  
Only if there is an ultimate balance between all the different goals, you are able to stay on top of your game and attract both consumers and suppliers to your platform!

### Definitions

The words **“objective”** and **“goal”** are sometimes used interchangeably. But goals and objectives are actually separate items. Each have their own unique and important roles. In this FAST Design manual the following definitions are used:

**Goals -** A high-level, broad, non-specific, and long-term definition of outcomes. Goals are not measurable, and several iterations are needed to achieve a goal. Some people say that goals do not need to be defined, as long as there is clear understanding of the narrative. But, objectives are always needed. 

**Objectives** - Influenced by goals, an objective is a low-level description of the specific and measureable outcomes desired from a platform opportunity. Activities and most likely deliverables will contribute to achieving the objective. The Platform opportunity and its objectives must always contribute to the goal.

### Defining the goals

Brainstorm about the impact that needs to be made and the goal that needs to be achieved;  
- What is important from a consumers, producers and the **business** perspective;  
- Is it possible to combine all the different perspectives and find the right **balance**?

### Defining the objectives

For each goal define \(up to a maximum of 5\) SMART objectives  
- Decide what focus will help; Focus on the HOW \(leading objectives focus on input\) or on the WHY \(lagging objectives focus on output\)  
- Try to quantify the objectives. Make them SMART in order to be sure these objectives are measurable.

#### Check if the goals and objectives are still aligned with the narrative!

#### _Leading and lagging objectives_

Lagging indicators are typically “output” oriented. They are easy to measure but hard to improve or influence. Leading indicators are typically input oriented, hard to measure and easy to influence. Let's illustrate this with a simple example: For many of people a personal goal is weight loss. 

A clear lagging indicator that is easy to measure. When stepping on a scale the answer is clear. But how to actually reach this goal? For weight loss there are 2 “leading” indicators: 1. Calories taken in and 2. Calories burned. These 2 indicators are easy to influence but very hard to measure. When ordering lunch in a restaurant the amount of calories is not listed on the menu. And many people have no clue how many calories a person burns on a given day. 

Most financial indicators such as revenue, profit, costs are “lagging indicators”. They are results of the activities of an organisation.  
Leading indicators are often related to activities undertaken by employees or customers.
