### Ecosystem Interaction fit 

The Opportunity gear was all about exploring a potential opportunity within the ecosystem. In the Experience gear it is all about the potential within the ecosystem. But until now all the output was largely based on assumptions. So, time to validate these assumptions and decide if it is possible to continue with the design process!

This step is about validating if the right problem, pressure or goal is being addressed. For this purpose it is possible to use qualititative and quantitative methods.  
  
95% of people’s behaviour is determined on a subconscious level. Through research – like online questionnaires or face-to-face in depth-interviews – interviewees re asked various questions, such as; "Why did you select this service?".  Or "Would you want to use this service?". But by asking questions   their conscious level is at work and looking for answers \(that 5%\). Those opinions are bad predictors of behaviour.

So most of the time people don’t give a proper answer. This is why the phrase “People don’t act up on their words and don’s tell us what they do”! is heard so many times. They will tell what they think but in fact they will act up on their feelings! And those feelings hide below surface.  
So make sure the proper questions are used!

#### Suggestions on Quantative research:

* Use the quantative research for "What"and "How many" questions
* The book "The Mom Test" by Rob Fitzpatrick can help in preparing the right questions \(look for a video on .•The MOM-test via [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocwlR0M0PuY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocwlR0M0PuY)\)
* Ask open questions
* No leading questions
* Start with easy questions \(about background and neutral questions\) and follow with more difficult/sensitive questions
* Ask them to show and tell•Don’t lead the user to the ‘right’ path
* Pay attention what users do, not what they say
* Don’t ask what they want•Ask for further explanation•Make summaries

#### Suggestions on Qualitative research:

* Use the quantative research for an indication of the “Why”•
* Learn from desk research / investigate the facts / data-analysis / statistics
* Use a Landing page; Am I solving the right problem
* Talk to customers using images / pictures and stories
  * What do you see on the picture?
  * •How does this picture relates to ……?
  * What is your title for this picture?•Use laddering to explore the real need
* Use preto-typing

To help prepare for the interviews,  use the cheat sheet from the “PDT toolkit”. The cheat sheet contains all of the questions that needs to be answered!
