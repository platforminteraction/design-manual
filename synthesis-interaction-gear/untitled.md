# Articulation of the core value proposition

**Exchanging Value**

In the previous step the Motivation Matrix has helped in creating an overview of what the roles can ‘Give to’ each other and what the intrinsic motivation of each role is. Besides these insights an indication of what the most important relationships are, is created; Where is the value flow the most promising?  
Some relationships that did’t seem crucial before, now have emerged powerfully.  
This step is about identifying which interactions and channels already exist and what new ones need to be created.

At this point in the design process, it is also important that the shaper or designer identifies the roles on which to focus, while executing this next analyses. What relationships are going to be the core of the design work \(at least for the next iteration\)?

**How to use the Platform Value Canvas**

With the Platform Value Canvas it is possible to map all the interactions that are needed to realise the value exchange between the selected roles. The interactions can be inbound or outbound

* Inbound; What value brings this specific role to the platform;
* Outbound; What is this specific role getting from the other roles/ platform players.

**Suggestion**; Plot the narrative of the platform in the center of the canvas.This will make it easier to:

* Check if the interactions are in line with the narrative 
* determine that the narrative needs to be adapted because the interactions are deviating from the narrative

*  In the Motivation Matrix \(a maximum of\) 5 roles are analysed. Make a selection of \(maximum\) 4 of the most relevant roles and their relationships and plot them on the Platform Value Canvas.  _In both of the examples the selected 3 roles are the ones that are the most relevant._

*  Transfer all of the Value Propositions from the Motivation Matrix \(the column for each role\) to the Platform Value Canvas

*  Think about the inbound and outbound interactions that the platform peers need to realize value creation and exchange between them. _**Use a verb to phrase the interaction e.g. pitch, review, assign, protest, select, sign up, etc.**_

*  Map the currency flow to get a better understanding of the potential Business model \(revenue and cost model\). Think of alternative currencies besides money!

* Map the channels via which the platform peers can realize the interactions

This overview of all the **Value Propositions** with all the potential **interactions will** help to decide on how the platform can help to transact value in an easier, cheaper and faster way by providing and curating **channels** that will make the interactions more likely to happen. Besides that, the mapping of the **currency** flow will help in understanding how the potential business model \(revenue and cost model\) could look like.

**Tips:** After having mapped all the transactions that involve the selected roles try to:

* Identify the few ones which seem the most relevant. Focus to the exchanges that carry the most important platform value units such as money & reputation.
* Identify other transactions that may involve a large number of participants
* Identify those interactions that will need standardization to happen easily. Something that may not happen if there’s no channel available. 

At the end of the exercise try to connect the transactions that are linked in a sequence or experience.
