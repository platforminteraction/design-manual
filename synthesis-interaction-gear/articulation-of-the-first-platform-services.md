# Articulation of the first platform services

Now that the relevant interactions are identified it is time to consolidate most of the insights. Let’s focus on building the core platform service\(s\)! At the end of this activity the first tangible sign of the platform service\(s\) that can be offered becomes clear. One or more platform services will be part of your MVP, or will drive how to build the experiments that are need to validate the platform market fit.

### How to use the platform Service Canvas

The Platform Service Canvas can help in designing the core services the platform provides to allow a seamless  on-boarding, match-making, transaction and engagement of and between the platform peers. Next to this it helps in discovering the main activities, resources and technologies which will need to be in place and need to be managed in order to deliver these services.

#### Suggestion

*  Start with looking at the interactions that were linked in the previous exercise. Which services are needed  to facilitate these interactions;
* Best Practice: Customer Journey Mapping might be a useful approach to identify possible platform services.

*  Define the core services for the first role that support the focus area of on-boarding; First take a look at the transactions in the Platform Value Canvas; which ones are needed to onboard the different roles on the platform. After this try to come up with complementary services using the questions below:   
  **Onboard**

  * What services do the different stakeholders need to get on boarded onto the platform?
  * What attracts different stakeholders?
  * What are your stakeholders looking for, to make on boarding frictionless for them?

  **Match**

  * How will the matchmaking be done?
  * What are the key matching criteria?
  * What services the platform needs to provide to efficiently perform the matchmaking

  **Transact**

  * How will the goods / services be exchanged?
  * What is the nature / type of core transaction?
  * What are the key transactions?
  * What services the platform needs to provide to efficiently perform the transactions?

  **Engage**

  * How can you keep the different stakeholders engaged on the platform?
  * What kind of engagements are in favour for the stakeholders?
  * What services the platform needs to provide to efficiently perform the engagement?

*  Define the main activities, resources and technologies for the platform owner in order to realize these platform services, using these trigger questions:  
  **Activities**

  * What’s your job in this supply chain?
  * Which activities are essential to create these services?

  **Resources**

  *  Which resources do you need in order to realize these services?
  * Which resources are essential to fulfill your value propositions?

  **Technologies**

  * Which technologies are in use to realize the platform offering?

**Tips**:   
Check if the interactions that are facilitated by these services resonate with the Entity Portraits of the selected roles. With these interactions that are facilitated it is essential that they allow the different roles to:

*  Leverage in its potential
* To achieve goals
* Respond to performance pressures,
* Getting relevant gains in the process.
