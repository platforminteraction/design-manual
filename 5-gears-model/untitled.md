# Construct your narrative

Framing the platform opportunity means getting to the essence of the platform; Why are you here, What can we achieve and How should we connect to achieve this?

The platform needs a story that inspires and attracts partners, consumers and suppliers. A story that is concise but comprehensive. Specific but with room to grow. One that defines the platform‘s vision, communicates the strategy, and embodies the culture. You can achieve this by constructing a narrative! Narratives.

### Narratives <a id="narratives"></a>

A platform’s narrative, expresses the profound, authentic and sustainable behavior of the peers on which they build their experience. It is a key tool to help in designing for ecosystem behavior. 

A platform narrative has two key attributes: · First, they’re open-ended – there’s no resolution yet. The resolution of the narrative hinges upon the choices and actions that the entities in the ecosystem will take– the resolution is up to them. Second, narratives are about the people the narrative is trying to reach, not the individual or company crafting the narrative. Of course the company can play a role in helping those people to accomplish what they were meant to accomplish.

### How to construct your narrative <a id="how-to-construct-your-narrative"></a>

Brainstorm about the collective behavior your participants need to exhibit. What is important from the participants perspective \(participants in the scope you selected\); 

Use the Positioning framework to express the narrative
