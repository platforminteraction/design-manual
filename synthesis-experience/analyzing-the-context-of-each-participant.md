# Analyzing the context of each participant

### Motivations

When facing a platform design challenge you need to move beyond the customer centric “Job to be Done approach”. This approach is traditionally centered on solving problems and reducing frictions. 

For a platform design challenge it is better to embrace a radically new approach. An approach with more focus on the potential and motivations of all the entities that play a role in the Platform Ecosystem. This step is all about analyzing the context of each participant. To go deeper into the intrinsic motivation of this participant. For this step the “Entity Portrait” can be used.

Thanks to this tool a platform designer can now perform a portrait of every entity in the Ecosystem. The word “portrait” is not by chance. Portraits have the capacity to bring deep emphatic contact with the subject, and can help identify with it. A platform designer should identify with the different entities that are the recipients and co-creators of the narrative. Understand their motivations, hopes and the value they seek. This is about assets and capabilities the participant can leverage on to seek for individual gains. Meanwhile responding to the performance pressure and while trying to achieve its current goals.

### How to use the Entity portrait

By concentrating on both the entity’s current situation and the gains they are looking for, we can have a pretty comprehensive understanding on how to build a Value Proposition for this specific entity.

Tip; Use post-its to fill in the canvas. Using the post-its makes it easier to play around with the entities by replacing, removing or clustering them.

* Start by filling in the Entity’s Current Goals: What are the key goals of this entity in this current moment? E.g.: learning new skills, finding financial stability, generating more revenues, etc. 
* After the entity’s current goals you look into the Entity’s Performance Pressures: How — and why — is continuous disruption pushing this entity to improve its performances, hone new capabilities, and develop new solutions and approaches? 
* Third step is filling in the Entity’s leverage able Assets and Capabilities: what are the key assets the entity owns or has access to and what are the key capabilities the entity can count on when trying to achieve its goals?

In the second place the portrait helps to look into the three essential gains the platform should offer to the entity when participating on the platform.

* Convenience Gains: What are the elements of convenience that the entity is looking for? \(e.g.: not having to create and maintain a website, manage payments in a simple way, etc…\).
* Access & Reach Gains: What kind of enhanced access to ecosystem \(supply/demand\) is the entity seeking? How is the entity looking to augment its reach? \(e.g.: find more niche or aggregated demand, reaching new categories of peers, getting in contact with new geographies …\).
* Value Gains: What type of value is the entity mainly looking for? Is it looking for monetary value such as revenues or savings? Recognition? Experience? Security? Knowledge?

Remember:

* We don’t design an Ecosystem we design FOR an Ecosystem.
* It is all about PULL vs PUSH! You’re not going to sell the platform to the ecosystem.
* You’re not looking into your Platform but into your Ecosystem

So far all of the steps where about discovery. The next step will be about the validating the problem fit, or in other words the Platform Discovery.   
For this step a different mindset and even a different expertise \(on customer development\) is needed.   
Instructions on the 'Platform Discovery' activities can be found in the chapter "Customer Development" / "Platform Discovery".
