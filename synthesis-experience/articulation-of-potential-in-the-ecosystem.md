# Articulation of potential in the ecosystem

### The potential to exchange

Only continue with the design process if validated that there is an existing problem, a pressure or gain that can be addressed.

The goal of this step is to understand the possible connections between the various participants that can join the platform.Understanding these connections is key to design and build a Platform’s value proposition. The value proposition must address the potential to exchange value and the existing intrinsic motivations of the participants. Convincing everyone in the ecosystem that joining the platform will be a winning move is essential to the Platform’s success.

### How to use the Motivation Matrix

With The Ecosystem Motivations Matrix you can to dig deep into the motivations that push entities in the ecosystem to join the platform. It tracks the advantages in participating on the platform and what each entity can “give to” others. With this matrix it is possible to analyze the potential to exchange flows of value; in other words you will map

* what kind of value exchanges the entities are performing already \(or trying to\);
* what additional type of value they might exchange if properly enabled;
* the intrinsic motivation for participants to join the platform.

**Suggestion**; Select the most relevant interactions from the ecosystem Canvas you want to analyse to get more understanding of the friction, opportunity or threat you have identified.

* Plot the selected entities you used for the entity portraits to this matrix. Place the selected entities in the same order on the 1st row and column \(In the first box of the first column write one entity from the previous canvas. Write the same entity in the first box of the top row\). Continue by filling all the entity boxes. 
* For each entity you mark the corresponding role box \(PA, PP, PC\)

* Start to fill in the exchanges between the different entities. To identify these exchanges or “give to” potential you can use the questions below: o What are the advantages in participating? o What can each entity give to us? o What is the potential to exchange between the different roles?

* The diagonal boxes should be filled in last. These boxes identify the same-entity exchange \(the intrinsic motivation\)!

* Not all boxes must be filled with exchanges. It may be the case that there is no value exchanged yet or even potential to exchange. This should tell you something

####  Essential Tips and Tricks

* When in doubt.. add the exchange! This is a generative moment, do not limit yourself in this phase
* It is important to map any possibility to exchange money, reputation and feedback as they are powerful engines of value exchange and can drive up quality
* Ask yourself “what can A give to B?” and be surprised by the answers

This exercise will help you let the most important relationships to emerge \(an indication on where most of the value can flow\). You may well be surprised by some relationships that you didn’t deem “Crucial” for your design, but that can emerge powerfully as important
